# Image Denoising Using Auto Encoders
I successfully developed a model for image noise removal utilizing a basic autoencoder architecture. After training and evaluating the model with various datasets, it achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 81.84% in reducing noise and restoring the input images. This result highlights the potential of autoencoders in enhancing image quality by effectively denoising and improving the clarity of visual data.
